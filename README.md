# The-Blitz-Blog
My personal blog

Some interesting things about this app  
- Uses Notion as a CMS
- Fetches content as markdown from Notion and renders markdown as HTML
- Uses a [in-house client side router](https://github.com/BlitzJB/Clientside-Router) made on vanilla js
- Vanilla js based component driven approach
- My first time using express
